Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by an
overactive thyroid gland, resulting in excessive production
of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3). 
Common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease,
toxic nodular goiter, thyroiditis, and certain medications.
Symptoms may include weight loss, increased appetite, rapid
heart rate, anxiety, tremors, heat intolerance, sweating,
and fatigue. Hyperthyroidism can affect individuals of any
age, but it is more common in women. Diagnosis involves blood 
tests to measure thyroid hormone levels, thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH), and sometimes
imaging studies like a thyroid scan or ultrasound. 
Treatment options include medications to reduce thyroid 
hormone production, radioactive iodine therapy to shrink
the thyroid gland, or, in some cases, surgery to remove
part or all of the thyroid gland.
Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to complications such 
as heart problems, osteoporosis, and, in severe cases, a 
life-threatening condition called thyroid storm. It is 
crucial to seek medical attention for accurate diagnosis 
and appropriate management, which may involve a combination 
of medical interventions and ongoing monitoring.
