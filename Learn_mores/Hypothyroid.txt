Hypothyroidism is a medical condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, resulting in insufficient production of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones play a crucial role in regulating various metabolic processes in the body.

Common causes of hypothyroidism include autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), thyroid surgery, radiation therapy, certain medications, and iodine deficiency. Symptoms may include fatigue, weight gain, cold sensitivity, dry skin, constipation, depression, and impaired concentration. Hypothyroidism can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in women and tends to increase with age.

Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Treatment typically involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy, usually in the form of synthetic levothyroxine, to restore hormone levels and alleviate symptoms. Regular monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary to optimize thyroid function.

Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to complications such as cardiovascular issues, infertility, and neurological problems. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management tailored to individual needs.
